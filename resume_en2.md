## Education
**Master of Engineering**
Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo (Japan)
- Research at machine learning, computer vision and computer graphics supervised by Tatsuya Harada
- Mechano-Informatics Course
- Research member at [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://www.mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/)

**Bachelor of Engineering**
The University of Tokyo, Tokyo(Japan)
April 2016 - March 2020
- Research at machine learning, computer vision and computer graphics supervised by Tatsuya Harada
- Department of Mechano-Informatics
- Research member at [Machine Intelligence Lab](https://www.mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/)
- Learned computer science, robotics, statistics, mathematics, and mechanics
- some of the classes I took:
    - **Operating System** class by Kenjiro Taura
        - Learned the basics of operating system functions and structures, such as synchronous communication between processes, scheduling, and memory management not only through lectures but also through hands-on exercises on Ubuntu.
    - **Language Processing System** by Naoki Kobayashi
    - **Statistical Machine Learning** class by Masashi Sugiyama
        - Learned the basic theory of statistical machine learning and specific algorithms, such as SVM, EM algorithm, and non-parametric kernel density estimation. I implemented some algorithms such as k-means, k-NN, SVM with kernel methods in python and did experiments to evaluate their peformances.\footnote{}.

## Works
**[holoDesk](https://twitter.com/benmon0412/status/1085146690250694656?s=20)**
- I created an iOS app for my own cardboard AR goggle by combining iPhone and Leap Motion (hand tracking controller), providing hand gesture UX experiences. For example, you can watch your favorite movies in spaces around you, and change screen size using your hands. You can also search items in front of you in amazon.com.
- This is written in Swift using ARKit, but I rarely depended on ARKit's APIs and implemented most of the functions by myself because there are many functions that cannot be realized by existing ARKit libraries.
- I developed this application for a software development contest during the mechano-informatics class in 2019, and I won the 1st prize.

**[NoteScanner](https://github.com/dkasuga/NoteScanner)**
- Simple OCR app. It transcribes the text in the image to .txt file or converts codes on a book to .cpp file. You can also directly access the URLs in the images.
- Written in Python, using OpenCV.
- I developed this application for a software development contest during the mechano-informatics class in 2018, and I won the 1st prize.

**[Estimation of 3D Geometry and Material](https://github.com/dkasuga/EstimationOf3DGeometryAndMaterial)**
- Deep neural network model for my graduation thesis project. My theme is the combination of computer vision and computer graphics using deep learning.
- You can generate 3D Mesh and physically-based material from a single image.
- The codes are written in Python using PyTorch.

**[dkasuga9cc](https://github.com/dkasuga/dkasuga9cc)**
- A small C compiler written in C, made with reference to [Rui Ueyama's textbook](https://www.sigbus.info/compilerbook).


## Activity
**Competitive Programming**
- Active competitor on [atcoder.jp](https://atcoder.jp) and joined 11 contests. My rate is 932 and rank color is green.
- I usually use C++ to solve problems.

**OSS Development**
- I've participated in some OSS projects, such as TensorFlow Graphics or Kaolin, which are 3D Deep Learning Library for TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Experience
**Microsoft Japan**<br>
Windows 10 Sales Team<br>
April 2018 - March 2019
- A member of the Windows 10 sales promotion team and was involved in negotiations and marketing planning with advertising and sales agencies.
- I was also involved in running programming education events for high school students. I planned hands-on development of an MR painting application on Microsoft HoloLens, made with Unity using C#. I made tutorial materials for it and I actually taught the students as a tutor on the days.

## Skills
**Programming Lauguage**
- Python, C++, C, Swift, C#

**Framework/Technology**
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, ARKit, Unity

**Software/Environment**
- Vim, Git, Linux, macOS

- NoteScanner -> done
- contestの文面変える -> mechano-informatics class
- educationでとった授業について -> 一応done，言語処理系論
- 研究の話もう少し付け足す ->
- MSでのハンズオンの話をふくらませる -> done
- OSSの話をどこまで書くか

- 明日の目標はとりあえずここまでを遂行すること

残り
- texに落とし込む
- 自主プロ -> 動画を載せる，具体的にどういうことができるかを端的にまとめる，使ったコードのやつとかを載せる
    - コードはまだ整理中みたいなことを言う
    - きちんとレイアウトする
